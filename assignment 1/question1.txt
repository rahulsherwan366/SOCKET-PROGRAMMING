Brief note on the following structures commonly used in networking :

1.)   struct in_addr { u_long s_addr ; }
      This is a user defined structure which is used to populate IPA of the associated 
      socket address.As we can see over here It contains an unsigned long type data member 
      named s_addr. It stores 32âˆ’bits netID or hostID in NBO (4 bytes).

2.)   struct sockaddr_in {
                    short sin_family ; 
                    u_short sin_port ;
                    struct in_addr sin_addr ; 
                    char sin_zero [ 8 ] ;
                    }  
    sockaddr_in stands for socket address for internet.
    Above is a very famous structure in c which is deals with internet addresses. Its object
    are generally known as a socket address of struct sockaddr_in type.
         It contains four data members which sin_family, sin_port, sin_addr and sin_zero as 
    we con notice above. Now, sin_family takes the type of protocol socket of sockaddr_in wants
    to follow (i.e, generally AF_INET for IPv4 or AF_INET6 for IPv6).
         Next one is sin_port which is of unsigned short type generally takes 2 byte port number.
    There are port number which are basically important to know which program in a perticular IPA 
    has called or responded . So in specifing socket address the sin_port part is a must data member 
    which needs to be populated .
        Following sin_port is sin_addr which is of in_addr type which is explained above. This data 
    member populates the IPA part of socket address which is required to find the location of the
    location of the machine on the network.
        In the end comes, sin_zero which is basically a non-used data member of character string type.
    It is required just to add padding of 8 bytes which is really important if we want to type cast sockaddr_in
    to generic socket address .
